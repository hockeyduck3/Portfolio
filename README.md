* This is a site that I built from the ground up using HTML/Handlebars, CSS/Bootstrap, and Javascript/jQuery.

* This site is currently live on heroku at this link: https://ljspencer.dev

Welcome to the repo for my Portfolio website! I'm continuing to learn and grow my website as I grow as a developer. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me!
