# My Portfolio Website

* This is a site that I built from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4.

* This site is currently live on github pages.

* This portfolio website was an assignment I had to make for class, but it will also be used as my main website.



This project was both fun and challenging as this was my first time ever using Bootstrap.

I followed the example page that my school gave me, but added my own creative spin on the design and color palatte of the page.

Using Bootstrap definitly helped make this project go by much faster and made it so I didn't have to rely on media query's as much to make my website responsive. 

I'm really happy with this project and the way the site turned out! I put a lot of time and effort into this page and pushed myself with this project. 

As I continue to learn I will definitly continue to build this page to be better than it is now.
