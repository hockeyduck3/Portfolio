# My Portfolio Website

* This is a site that I built from the ground up using HTML/Handlebars, CSS/Bootstrap, and Javascript/jQuery.

* This site is currently live on heroku at this link: https://ljspencer.dev

* This portfolio website was an assignment I had to make for class, but it is also my main website.

As I continue to learn I will definitly continue to build this page to be better than it is now.
