# My Portfolio Website

This portfolio website was my second assignment for school. But it's also going to be my personal website from now on.

I built this site from the ground up and used Bootstrap to help with the design and the layout of the webpage. 

This project was both fun and challenging as this was my first time ever using Bootstrap.

I followed the example page that my school gave me, but added my own creative spin on the design and color palatte of the page.

Using Bootstrap definitly helped make this project go by much faster and made it so I didn't have to rely on media query's as much to make my website responsive. 

I'm really happy with this project and the way the site turned out! I put a lot of time and effort into this page and pushed myself with this project. 

As I continue to learn I will definitly continue to build this page to be better than it is now.
